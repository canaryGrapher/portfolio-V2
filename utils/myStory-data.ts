        info: "I have had a love for cars for as long as I remember. I have always been crazy about Sports and Muscle cars. I am a classic Top Gear and The Grand Tour fan. I used to sketch vehicles as a teenager in my free time and was (still is) a big fan of shows like Top Gear and The Grand Tour. This interest made me choose my major as Automotive Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology in 2018."

        info: "In my junior year at the university, I got my wings, ready to explore uncharted waters. I joined many student clubs, left a lot within weeks of joining, made many friends, and somehow got interested in developing for the web. This is where my passion for cars declined. I got interested in making websites and other web-related programs, and thatâ€™s how I joined the tech universe."

        info: "I took up my first project, where my task was to assist in making a website for scheduling doctor appointments. This interested me in WebDev, which led me to take on many more projects. As I got drawn more into Web Development, I started looking for what was going on. I discovered that JavaScript was the complete solution for WebDev with NodeJS and ReactJS in the picture. I started learning NodeJS, which took me considerable time because of my inexperience in backend development."

        info: "I got duped into free work, laugh at me or pity me; I don't care. I started learning ReactJS to make it easier to create complex WebApps. The covid was my biggest helpline. I had so much time on my hand that I kept learning more and more. I looked into server-side rendering and static site generation. I kept gulping libraries after libraries, using them in multiple projects. I was progressing faster in learning and finishing projects. The more I learned, the more confident I felt about myself."

        year: "2021",
        info: "I started a test server at my university for under-development projects by converting an old CPU and installing Ubuntu Server on it. I did numerous rounds at the IT department to acquire a static public IP address. This was the first time I learned about static IPs and how a system on the internet can be accessed by anyone and anywhere through a static IP. I got more curious. I started learning about port forwarding, proxies and reverse proxies, DNS, VPNs, and various ports other than 80 and 443. I learned how to install certificates for a website and deploy websites. During the summer break, I took up an internship at nonceblox Private Limited, my first official experience as a Web developer. This company was working on blockchain, and I was already exploring blockchain because of an upcoming project at my university. I earned for the first time, and I was doing it all while learning. I worked with Web3, and it got me fascinated. I started an all-out invasion of the blockchain resources. Meanwhile, I had to learn TypeScript and Git while doing my internship to keep up with various libraries like GatsbyJS and NestJS."
