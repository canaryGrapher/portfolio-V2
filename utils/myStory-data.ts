        info: "I have had love for cars for as long as I remember. I have always been crazy about Sports and Muscles cars. I was classic Top Gear and The Grand Tour fan. I used to sketch cars as a teenager in my free time, and was (still is) a big fan of shows like Top Gear and The Grand Tour. This interest was what made me choose my majors as Automotive Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology in 2018."

Although I got interested in coding a bit late, my passion for computers have always been prevalent, but untouched. I was around ten when I first got my hands on a computer, a really old one, and since then, my experiments with computers have been endless."

This is where my passion for cars declined and I got interested in making websites and other web related programs, and thatâ€™s how I joined the tech universe."

        info: "I took up my first project where my task was to assist making a website for scheduling doctor appointments. This got me interested in WebDev which led me to take up many more projects. As I got drawn more into Web Development, I started looking for what was going on in the world. I discovered that JavaScript was the complete solution for WebDev with NodeJS and ReactJS in the picture. I started learning NodeJS, which took me considerable time to learn because of my inexperience in the backend development."

        info: "I got duped into free work by a person, and that was a learning point for me. I started learning ReactJS to make it easier for making complex WebApps. The covid was my biggest helpline. I had so much time on my hand that I kept on learning more and more. I looked into server side rendering and static site generation. I kept learning libraries after libraries, using them in multiple projects. I was progressing faster in learning and finishing projects."

        info: "I started a test server at my university for under developent projects by converting an old CPU and installing Ubuntu Server on it. I did numerous rounds at the IT department to acquire a static public IP address. This was the first time I was learning about static IPs and how a system on the internet can be accessed by anyone and anywhere in the world through a static IP. I got more curious. I started learning about port forwading, proxies and reverse proxies, DNS, VPNs and various ports used other than 80 and 443. I learned how to install certificates for a website and how to deploy websites. During the summer break, I took up an internship at nonceblox Private Limited. This was my first official experience as a Web developer. THis company was working on blockchain, and I was already exploring blockchain because of an upcoming project at my university. I earned for the first time and I was doing it all while learing. I worked with Web3 and it got me fascinated. I started an all out invasion on the blockchain resources."
