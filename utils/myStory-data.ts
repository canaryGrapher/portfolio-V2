        info: "I also have a love for cars. I have always been crazy for Sports cars and American Muscles. I used to sketch cars as a teenager in my free time, and was (still is) a big fan of shows like Top Gear and The Grand Tour. This interest was what made me choose my majors as Automotive Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology in 2018."

        info: "I was sixteen when I first got interested in coding after I took a course on the C++ programming langauge in high school. Although I got interested in coding a bit late, my passion for computers have always been prevalent, but untouched. I was around ten when I first got my hands on a computer, a really old one, and since then, my experiments with computers have been endless."

I joined a lot of student clubs, left a lot within weeks of joining, made a lot of friends and somehow got interesed in developing for the web. This is where my passion for cars declined and I got interested in making websites and other web related programs, and thatâ€™s how I joined the tech universe."
